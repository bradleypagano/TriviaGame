# TriviaGame

I set out to make a trivia game that was truly trivial.  Not many people in the Unites States will know all the answers to these questions.  That's most likely because most Americans don't watch Formula 1.  See if you can get all the questions correct.

We had to manipulate the DOM to complete this project.  What I did was hide the questions when the page is loaded.  After the user clicks the start button, the hidden area of the page becomes visibile and a timer counts down.  Once you have all the questions answered, you can click the submit button to go to the "win screen."  Also, if you run out of time, the game ends abd you are taken to the win screen.
